ImageJ macros for 3D region isolation, enhancement, and cell analysis.

1. Run 1 3D Brain Region Enhancement
2. Follow the prompts to extract an ROI and substack as required. Considerng using CLAHE for local contrast enhancement in difficult samples.
3. Run 2 3D Cell Counter
4. Use options to adjust detection settings and/or redirect intensity measurements to specific channels. If images have been enhanced with CLAHE, intensity measurements will not reflect true intensity.
